Assignment-1 is done by using Jupyter Notebook.This assignment mainly focus on Numpy and Matplotlib. NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython.

## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-2
In This assignmet, we learn by creatininvolves implementing various programming elements using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The first part involves working with a provided CSV file, where the student must perform basic statistical analysis, check for null values and replace them with the mean, and aggregate data using various functions. The second part involves working with two different datasets (Titanic and Glass) and implementing Na√Øve Bayes and linear SVM methods using scikit-learn, as well as visualizing correlations within the datasets. The student must also report on the accuracy of each method and justify which algorithm achieved better accuracy.
